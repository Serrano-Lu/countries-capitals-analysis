# countries-capitals-analysis
 project 2
This project analyzes data on countries and their capitals, including additional metrics such as population, GDP, literacy rate, and Human Development Index (HDI), scraped from Wikipedia. Using Python, we gathered and cleaned data from multiple pages and answered five key questions, with visualizations to highlight trends across continents and languages.
